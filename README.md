## Purpose Overview

Determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Then, write a report that summarizes the analysis and helps prepare Bobby’s manager for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.

### Deliverable 1 Instructions

- Using the included ERD as a reference, create a Retirement Titles table that holds all the titles of current employees who were born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955.
  - Because some employees may have multiple titles in the database—for example, due to promotions; use the DISTINCT ON statement to create a table that contains the most recent title of each employee.
- Then, use the COUNT() function to create a final table that has the number of retirement-age employees by most recent job title.

### Deleverable 2 Instructions

- Using the included ERD as a reference,create a mentorship-eligibility table that holds the current employees who were born between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965.
